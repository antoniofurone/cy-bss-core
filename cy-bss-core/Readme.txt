Cy-bss-core is a core business service system that provides a set of common services to support the development of business apps.
The services are provided via rest web services. 
Cy-bss-core is based on a set of open source products: Spring, LogBack, AngularJs, Bootstrap.
Pruduct requires JRE 1.7 or above, servlet container (has been tested using Tomcat 7), and MySql 5.7 or above.
Althought the project is at initial phase and only a small set of services and operations are implemented, its are already
useful to develope various types of app. Urbanbot (https://github.com/antoniofurone/cy-urbanbot.git) is an example of this app.

	- access using cybss user (for example: mysql -u cybss -p), select database cybss (digit: use cybss;), and run script under
		DataBase/MySql/tables from cr_tb_01_*.sql to cr_tb_<n>_*.sql;
	- DataBase/MySql/setup -> run script from load_tb_01_*.sql to load_tb_<n>_*.sql;	
	- DataBase/MySql/config -> run script from config_01_*.sql to config_<n>_*.sql;
	- DataBase/MySql/views -> run script from cr_vw_01_*.sql to cr_vw_<n>_*.sql;

	mysql.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/cybss
	mysql.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
	mysql.user=cybss
	mysql.psw=cybss
